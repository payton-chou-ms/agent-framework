**Decision needed:**
- [ ] **Determine if this should match README.zh-tw.md or serve a different purpose**
  - If duplicate: Consider removing or redirecting to README.zh-tw.md
  - If different purpose: Document the distinction
  - If condensed version: Expand to match README.md

---

## Medium Priority Updates (Extended Tutorials)

These files are comprehensive tutorials that are intentionally more detailed than English READMEs. They should only be updated if:
- The framework API changed significantly
- New features were added that should be documented
- Code examples no longer work

### 5. `/multimodal_input/multimodal_input.zh-tw.md` - MINOR UPDATE

    - Mixed multimodal content

**Verification:**
- [ ] All code examples are tested
- [ ] All file paths are correct

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize high-priority files:** Start with `/devui/README.zh-tw.md` and `/observability/README.zh-tw.md`
2. **Make decisions on file purposes:** Clarify what devui.zh-tw.md and observability.zh-tw.md should contain
3. **Update extended tutorials:** Only if framework changes require it
4. **Decide on English versions:** For context_providers, evaluation, and tools directories
5. **Test all code examples:** Ensure they work with current framework version
6. **Run verification scripts:** Use the comparison scripts to verify updates
